Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/deit-base-distilled-patch16-224 were not used when initializing DeiTForImageClassification: ['cls_classifier.weight', 'distillation_classifier.bias', 'cls_classifier.bias', 'distillation_classifier.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DeiTForImageClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DeiTForImageClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DeiTForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/deit-base-distilled-patch16-224 and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
